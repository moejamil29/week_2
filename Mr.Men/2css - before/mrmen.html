                    Mr Happy decided to have a party, so he set off to invite his friends
                    and buy the things he needed. First, he met Little Miss Busy. 
                    <q>Good morning!</q> Mr Happy said. <q>Would you like to ...</q> 
                    but Little Miss Busy was already rushing away! <strong><q>Sorry, can't stop!</q></strong> she called back.
                    <q>I suppose she's too busy to come to a party anyway,</q> said Mr Happy. 
                    <q>I'll ask someone else.</q>

                    Mr Greedy

                <p>
                    Mr Happy went to the cake shop. Mr Happy thought it would be nice to share 
                    a birthday cake with his friends.
                    But Mr Greedy was already in the shop, buying the <b>last cake. 
                    <q>Sorry, can't chat!</q></b> Mr Geedy said, licking his lips as he rushed off. 
                    He didn't say happy birthday to Mr Happy, but Mr Happy didn't mind.                         <q>Not to worry,</q> said Mr Happy. <q>I'll go and get some balloons.</q>
                 </p>

                <h3>
                    Little Miss Helpful
                </h3>
                <p>
                    On his way to the balloon shop, Mr Happy saw Little Miss Helpful. She was carrying a lot of balloons.
                     <q>Hello, Little Miss Helpful!</q> said Mr Happy. <q>I see you've been to the ballon shop. Can you
                    please tell me the way?</q> he asked. <q>Sorry, I...I can't help you!</q> said Little Miss Helpful, and she rushed off.
                    She didn't wish Mr Happy a happy birthday and she didn't offer to share her balloons.<strong><q>That's a very odd,</q></strong> thought Mr Happy.
                     <strong><q>Little Miss Helpful is normally SO helpful.</q></strong>

                Mr Birthday, Little Miss Birthday and friends
            </h3>
            <p>
                Just then, he spotted Mr and Little Miss Birthday, hurrying along. Mr Happy smiled.
                 They will definitely come to my party! he thought. But...
                <b><q>Sorry, we've got plans today,</q></b> they told him as they rushed off. Even 
                they didn't say happy birthday - and they loved birthdays more than anyone!
                Mr Happy decided to give up and go home. But can you imagine what he found when he got there?
                <strong>All his friends!</strong>
                <b>Mr Birthday</b> and <b>Little Miss Birthday</b> were there! <b>Little Miss Helpful</b> 
                was there with the balloons. <b>Mr Greedy</b> was there with the cake. And <b>Little Miss Busy</b> 
                was there, too. She'd been busy because she was planning a suprise party for him!
                <strong><q>Happy Birthday!</q></strong> they all cheered. Mr Happy <b>grinned a very big grin. 
                <q>It really is a happy birthday!</q></b> he chuckled.
